# Flipkart-Image-Downloader
This Python script downloads images from Flipkart URLs provided in a text file and saves them in JPEG format. It replaces the URLs' image sizes with the original size and saves the images to the "flipkart_IMG" directory. It uses the requests library to fetch the images and the Pillow library to convert them to JPEG format.
